# Lab Report 5 (Week 9)
## Part 1
What environment are you using (computer, operating system, web browser, terminal/editor, and so on)?



Detail the symptom you're seeing. Be specific; include both what you're seeing and what you expected to see instead. Screenshots are great, copy-pasted terminal output is also great. Avoid saying “it doesn't work”.



Detail the failure-inducing input and context. That might mean any or all of the command you're running, a test case, command-line arguments, working directory, even the last few commands you ran. Do your best to provide as much context as you can.

TA's Response:

screenshot/terminal output showing what information the student got from trying that, and a clear description of what the bug is.
