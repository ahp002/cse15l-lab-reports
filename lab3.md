Tuesday, September 11, 2001, dawned temperate and nearly cloudless in the eastern United States. Millions of men and women readied themselves for work. Some made their way to the Twin Towers, the signature structures of the World Trade Center complex in New York City. Others went to Arlington, Virginia, to the Pentagon. Across the Potomac River, the United States Congress was back in session. At the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue, people began to line up for a White House tour. In Sarasota, Florida, President George W. Bush went for an early morning run.
    At 8:46:40, American 11 crashed into the North Tower of the World Trade Center in New York City.
    All on board, along with an unknown number of people in the tower, were killed instantly.
    At 9:03:11, United Airlines Flight 175 struck the South Tower of the World Trade Center.
    All on board, along with an unknown number of people in the tower, were killed instantly.
    F-15 fighters were scrambled at 8:46 from Otis Air Force Base. But NEADS did not know where to send the alert fighter aircraft, and the officer directing the fighters pressed for more information:"I don't know where I'm scrambling these guys to. I need a direction, a destination." Because the hijackers had turned off the plane's transponder, NEADS personnel spent the next minutes searching their radar scopes for the primary radar return. American 11 struck the NorthTower at 8:46. Shortly after 8:50, while NEADS personnel were still trying to locate the flight, word reached them that a plane had hit the World Trade Center. 
    In summary, NEADS received notice of the hijacking nine minutes before it struck the North Tower. That nine minutes' notice before impact was the most the military would receive of any of the four hijackings. 
    The controllers observed the plane in a rapid descent; the radar data terminated over Lower Manhattan. At 9:03, United 175 crashed into the South Tower.
Military Notification and Response. The first indication that the NORAD air defenders had of the second hijacked aircraft, United 175, came in a phone call from New York Center to NEADS at 9:03. The notice came at about the time the plane was hitting the South Tower.
    Reagan National controllers then vectored an unarmed National Guard C- 130H cargo aircraft, which had just taken off en route to Minnesota, to identify and follow the suspicious aircraft. The C-130H pilot spotted it, identified it as a Boeing 757, attempted to follow its path, and at 9:38, seconds after impact, reported to the control tower:"looks like that aircraft crashed into the Pentagon sir."
    FAA: That was another-it was evidently another aircraft that hit the tower. That's the latest report we have.
    At the White House, Vice President Dick Cheney had just sat down for a meeting when his assistant told him to turn on his television because a plane had struck the NorthTower of the World Trade Center. The Vice President was wondering "how the hell could a plane hit the World Trade Center" when he saw the second aircraft strike the South Tower.
    The President and the Vice President The President was seated in a classroom when, at 9:05, Andrew Card whispered to him: "A second plane hit the second tower. America is under attack." The President told us his instinct was to project calm, not to have the country see an excited reaction at a moment of crisis. The press was standing behind the children; he saw their phones and pagers start to ring. The President felt he should project strength and calm until he could better understand what was happening.
    At 9:33, the tower supervisor at Reagan National Airport picked up a hotline to the Secret Service and told the Service's operations center that "an aircraft [is] coming at you and not talking with us." This was the first specific report to the Secret Service of a direct threat to the White House. No move was made to evacuate the Vice President at this time. As the officer who took the call explained, "[I was] about to push the alert button when the tower advised that the aircraft was turning south and approaching Reagan National Airport."

Introduction
        The evidence that adolescent diet may affect the risk of
        breast cancer derives from several lines of evidence [ 1 ]
        . Rates of breast cancer among Asian immigrants to the
        United States do not approach those of US white women until
        the second or third generation, suggesting that exposures
        during childhood and adolescence are important in
        establishing a higher risk of breast cancer [ 2 3 ] .
        Norwegian women who were adolescents during World War II,
        when average caloric intake decreased by 22%, have a
        reduced incidence of breast cancer, suggesting that energy
        restriction might affect risk [ 4 ] . Similarly, in animal
        models, energy restriction in the peripubertal period
        inhibits mammary tissue proliferation and reduces the
        subsequent risk of mammary tumors [ 5 6 ] . Exposure of
        rats to carcinogens before first pregnancy increases the
        incidence of mammary tumors compared with exposure after
        first pregnancy [ 7 ] . After differentiation of the
        mammary gland at the time of first full-term pregnancy of
        the rat, the rate of cell division decreases and length of
        the cell cycle increases, allowing more time for DNA repair
        [ 8 ] . This biologic phenomenon might explain the apparent
        vulnerability of the adolescent breast tissue to
        carcinogenic exposures. Among atomic bomb survivors and
        women exposed to ionizing radiation as part of their
        treatment for Hodgkin's disease, the risk of breast cancer
        increases with younger age at exposure [ 9 ] .
        Although this analysis was principally an exploratory
        analysis to guide prospective studies, the authors had
        previously proposed that certain elements of adolescent
        diet might be protective against future risk of breast
        cancer [ 10 ] . For instance, we and others have proposed
        that fiber might be protective by lowering endogenous
        estrogen levels and that folate might be protective owing
        to its role in DNA methylation.
      
      
        Methods
        
          Study population
          This study was conducted among the participants of the
          Nurses' Health Study, a prospective cohort of 121,700
          women who have completed biennial questionnaires on
          medical events and lifestyle factors since the initiation
          of the study in 1976, when the women were 30-55 years of
          age [ 11 ] . The study has been approved by the
          institutional review board at the Brigham and Women's
          Hospital, Boston.
        
        
          High school food-frequency questionnaire
          In 1986, when participants were 40-65 years of age,
          they completed a 24-item food-frequency questionnaire
          (FFQ) about diet between the ages of 12 and 18 years. The
          FFQ was designed to include foods that account for major
          sources of fat, antioxidant vitamins, and carotenoids.
          For each food item on the FFQ, a unit or portion size was
          specified. Subjects were asked how often, on average,
          they had consumed the specified amount of each item. Nine
          possible responses were provided ranging from 'never' to
          Nutrient intakes were computed for each subject by
          assigning a weight proportional to the frequency of use
          of each food, multiplying this weighting by the nutrient
          value for the specified portion size, and summing the
          contributions of all foods. The nutrient database used in
          this study was derived from the US Department of
          Agriculture's handbook [ 12 ] with additional information
          from McCance and Widdowson [ 13 ] and also from data
          obtained from food manufacturers. The database
          incorporates research on the historical trends in the
          enrichment of the food supply, such as the addition of
          vitamin D to milk (beginning in about 1932) and vitamin A
          to margarine (in about 1941). For vitamin A, women born
          before 1942 were assigned 'unenriched' values; women born
          after 1942 were assigned 'enriched' values. The
          questionnaire has been shown to be highly reproducible
          and not significantly correlated with current diet as an
          adult ( 
          r = 0.25) [ 14 ] .
          Participants who had completed the high school diet
          assessment section of the 1986 follow-up questionnaire
          and who also had reported current diet in 1980 were
          eligible for the study. Incident cases of breast cancer,
          confirmed by medical record review, diagnosed after the
          report of current diet in 1980 and before the return of
          the 1986 questionnaire on which high school diet was
          reported, were eligible for inclusion in the study ( 
          n = 1313). The analysis included
          both 
          in situ and invasive cases of
          breast cancer. One hundred and thirty-six cases died
          before the mailing of the 1986 questionnaire, 69 cases
          did not return the 1986 questionnaire, and 175 cases did
          not fill out the high school diet section of the 1986
          questionnaire. Cases were excluded from the analysis if
          the total calories reported on high school diet were
          implausible, i.e. less than 500 or greater than 4500 ( 
          n = 16), if the reported age at
          menarche was greater than 21 years ( 
          n = 9), or if they had previously
          been diagnosed with cancer other than breast cancer ( 
          n = 65). The final case pool ( 
          n = 843) included 64% of the cases
          diagnosed between 1980 and 1986. Included cases had a
          later age at menarche, were more likely to be
          premenopausal, and were more likely to report a family
          history of breast cancer than cases excluded from the
          analysis (data not shown). Controls were matched to cases
          by month and year of birth in a 10:1 ratio. The exclusion
          criteria for controls were the same as for cases.
        
        
          Statistical analysis
          Controls were assigned the date of diagnosis of their
          matched case. The risk factor status of both cases and
          controls was updated from the questionnaire most recently
          completed before date of diagnosis (controls were
          assigned the date of diagnosis of their matched case).
          Risk factors that were updated included menopausal
          status, family history, diagnosis of benign breast
          disease, and postmenopausal hormone use. All tests of
          significance were two-sided. Differences in risk factor
          status between cases and controls were tested with χ 2or 
          t -tests.
          Foods were analyzed as continuous variables based on
          using quintiles of nutrient intake, according to the
          distribution in the control population. Multiple logistic
          regression was used to estimate relative risks as odds
          ratios (and 95% confidence intervals [CIs]) while
          controlling simultaneously for potentially confounding
          variables. Trends across quintiles were tested with the
          use of the logistic model. Relative risks were estimated
          as odds ratios (and 95% CIs) while controlling
          simultaneously for potentially confounding variables.
          Trends across quintiles were tested with the use of the
          logistic model. Relative risks (RR) were calculated by
          comparing the highest and lowest quintiles of nutrient
          intake (Q 
          5 versus Q 
          1 ). Multivariate models included age
          at diagnosis, family history of breast cancer in mother
          or sister, diagnosis of benign breast disease (BBD), age
          at menarche (in quintiles), body mass index at age 18 (in
          deciles), adult height (in quartiles), reproductive
          history (categorical), and vitamin A intake (continuous)
          in 1980 [ 15 ] . Current vitamin A intake was included in
          the model because we have previously shown in this cohort
          of women that lower intake of vitamin A is positively
          associated with an increased risk of breast cancer.
          Reproductive history was represented by dummy variables,
          indicating whether the subject had children, and, if so,
          the number of children (one, two, or more than two
          children) and the age at which the first child was born
          (before age 24, between ages 25 and 29 inclusive, or age
          30 or older).
        
      
      
        Results
        Breast cancer cases had later age at first birth, lower
        parity, increased adult height, and higher incidence of
        BBD, and were more likely than controls to have a family
        history of breast cancer. Cases also reported lower vitamin
        A intake and higher alcohol intake in 1980 than did
        controls (data not shown).
        Increased consumption of eggs was associated with
        decreased risk of breast cancer (RR = 0.82 per increase of
        Consumption of butter was positively associated with
        increased risk of breast cancer (RR = 1.06; 95% CI
        1.00-1.13). RR values for individual foods were generally
        similar for premenopausal and postmenopausal women. Foods
        were grouped according to type (fruits, vegetables, dairy,
        red meat, chicken, fish), but none of the groupings was
        significantly related to risk of breast cancer.
        Nutrient analysis, controlling for other established
        risk factors, showed that greater consumption of vegetable
        fat (RR [Q 
        5 ] = 0.85, 
        P [trend] = 0.05) and dietary fiber
        (RR [Q 
        5 ] = 0.78; 
        P [trend] = 0.09) were related to a
        reduced risk of breast cancer (Table 2). No other
        associations between nutrient intake and risk of breast
        cancer were observed. Inclusion versus exclusion of adult
        height, which might be on the causal pathway between
        adolescent diet and adult health, did not substantially
        alter the results reported.
      
      
        Discussion
        In this nested case-control study, the relation of
        adolescent diet to risk of breast cancer was evaluated
        among participants in the Nurses' Health Study who had
        completed a 24-item FFQ about diet during high school.
        Increased consumption of eggs was inversely associated with
        risk of breast cancer. Eggs are rich sources of essential
        amino acids, minerals and vitamins. For instance, one egg
        contains 11.5% of the recommended daily allowance for
        folate and 6.5% of that for vitamin D [ 16 ] . Conversely,
        increased consumption of butter was associated with a
        slight increase in risk. Neither animal fat, total fat, nor
        unsaturated fat was associated with increased risk on
        nutrient analysis; however, another nutrient in butter
        might confer increased risk, or the consumption of butter
        might be a proxy for another risk factor.
        When specific nutrients were examined, increased
        consumption of both vegetable fat and dietary fiber was
        associated with a decreased risk of breast cancer. Fiber
        might affect the risk of breast cancer by decreasing
        estrogen levels; fiber binds estrogen excreted into the
        gastrointestinal tract and reduces enterohepatic
        circulation [ 17 18 ] . In addition, higher dietary fiber
        intake has been associated with higher plasma levels of
        sex-hormone-binding globulin, which can reduce the
        bioavailability of estrogens [ 19 ] . The potential
        mechanism of a protective effect of vegetable fat is more
        speculative: vegetable fat is a composite of multiple forms
        of fatty acids, some of which have been proposed to
        increase risk (such as C 
        18:2 n-6) whereas other specific fatty
        acids have been proposed to decrease risk (such as C 
        18:1 , the primary fatty acid in olive
        oil) [ 20 ] . More detail on the type and composition of
        the vegetable oil used is necessary to pursue this relation
        with greater precision.
        Several limitations to the study exist. First, the
        validity of diet data recalled from 22 to 47 years in the
        past is unknown. Although we have shown that this recall is
        reproducible and is not highly correlated with current diet
        [ 14 ] , we can only infer validity. Potischman 
        et al. [ 21 ] have shown that there
        is a strong degree of concordance between the report of
        mother and the report of daughter about foods consumed
        during this age period, although others have shown that
        recall of diet from the distant past is imprecise [ 22 ] .
        However, in the absence of dietary data actually collected
        during adolescence, recall of high school diet provides the
        best estimate of possible relationships between diet during
        adolescence and the risk of breast cancer.
        Second, the 24-item FFQ is too short for complete
        assessment of total energy intake or specific nutrients.
        For instance, the intake of folate calculated from high
        school FFQ is much lower than the range seen in adult women
        [ 23 ] ; median intake group in the top quintile of intake
        restricted list of foods from which the nutrients were
        derived, more emphasis should be placed on the analysis of
        foods than of nutrients when interpreting these data.
        A third limitation of the current study is the
        possibility of recall bias because high school diet history
        was obtained after diagnosis of breast cancer. The most
        prevalent, although apparently incorrect, dietary
        hypothesis among the general population in 1986 was the
        notion that increased fat consumption significantly
        increased risk. Nevertheless, in this study the lack of
        association of fat intake suggests that recall bias was
        probably not a major factor. However, the brevity of this
        questionnaire might not have permitted complete recording
        of all sources of fat.
        A further limitation is the possibility of survivor
        bias. Only cases alive in 1986 who had completed the high
        school diet portion of the questionnaire were included in
        the analysis. If adolescent diet in any way increases the
        risk of mortality from breast cancer, women with these
        adverse dietary patterns would not be included in analysis,
        and the relation would be distorted. Finally, there remains
        the possibility of residual confounding by unmeasured
        factors, for instance socioeconomic status during childhood
        and its impact on dietary composition.
        Four other studies of the relation between childhood
        diet and breast cancer have been reported previously. Pryor
        
        et al. [ 24 ] conducted a
        case-control study of adolescent diet and breast cancer in
        Utah. Recall of diet was assessed by a modification of the
        Block questionnaire, selecting for foods higher in fat and
        fiber. No data were presented on the foods themselves; only
        possible relations between fat and fiber, stratified by
        menopausal status, were reported. Higher intake of fat from
        dairy sources was associated with a decreased risk of
        breast cancer for both premenopausal and postmenopausal
        women. This conclusion contrasts with the finding of our
        study in which a higher intake of butter was associated
        with a small increase in risk. A higher intake of fiber
        decreased risk in premenopausal women, whereas a higher
        intake of fiber was associated with an increased risk of
        breast cancer in postmenopausal women, analogous to a
        finding of the present study.
        Hislop 
        et al. [ 22 ] conducted a
        case-control study in British Columbia among 846 incident
        cases of breast cancer between 1980 and 1982. Women were
        asked to recall their dietary intake of 31 foods during
        early childhood (up to age 13 years). In premenopausal
        women, consumption of meat with visible fat during
        childhood was associated with an increased risk of breast
        cancer (RR ['three or more times per week' compared with
        'less than once per month'] = 2.69; 95% CI 1.26-5.80)
        Consumption of vegetable oils was associated with a reduced
        risk in premenopausal women (RR = 0.48; 95% CI 0.25-0.89).
        We also observed an inverse relationship between the intake
        of vegetable fat and the risk of breast cancer.
        Potischman 
        et al. [ 21 ] conducted a
        case-control study among 1647 cases who had been diagnosed
        with breast cancer at less than 45 years of age.
        Participants were asked during a telephone interview to
        quantify their intake of 29 foods at ages 12-13 years. The
        mothers of the participants were also asked to recall their
        daughter's intake of foods at ages 12-13 years. The
        response of each mother was highly correlated with the
        daughter's report. The authors reported that increased
        consumption of high-fat meats was associated with an
        increased risk of breast cancer, whereas increased
        consumption of fruits and vegetables was associated with a
        non-significant but consistent decrease in risk of breast
        cancer.
      
      
        Conclusion
        The present study revealed that increased consumption of
        eggs was associated with a decreased risk of breast cancer,
        whereas increased consumption of butter was associated with
        a slight increase in risk. In addition, increased intake of
        vegetable oils and dietary fiber seemed to be inversely
        related to risk of breast cancer. Future studies of the
        relation between adolescent diet and risk of breast cancer
        are warranted and should include a more complete assessment
        of diet.

        Introduction
        Three-dimensional (3D) collagen gel culture has been
        used as an 
        in vitro model of 
        in vivo tissue contraction, a common
        feature of fibrosis, as well as the resolution of
        granulation tissue that characterizes repair [ 1, 2].
        Short-term co-cultures of monocytes with fibroblasts result
        in the inhibition of collagen gel contraction [ 3], while
        co-cultures of fibroblasts with neutrophils, or with
        neutrophil elastase (NE), augment contraction [ 4].
        Results in the linked study [ 5] demonstrated that 3D
        collagen gel contraction was augmented in extended
        co-cultures of fibroblasts and monocytes. Since MMPs play a
        prominent role in connective tissue degradation [ 6, 7, 8],
        the current study, an extension of this linked study, was
        designed to explore the potential role of MMPs in this
        process.

          Cells and cultures
          See Supplementary material.
          Preparation of collagen gels for three-dimensional
          co-culture
          Collagen gels were prepared as described previously [
          9]. For long-term co-culture, the medium was changed
          every 5 days. The areas of floating gels were measured
          using an image analyzer.
          To investigate the effect of PGE 
          2 on collagen degradation,
          indomethacin (1 μM) or PGE 
          2 (0.1 μM) was added to the
          medium.
          Gelatinase activity assay
          Gelatin zymography was performed by modification of a
          previously published procedure to identify MMPs 1 and 9 [
          Immunoblot analysis of metalloproteinases
          To further identify the MMPs produced, immunoblots for
          MMPs 1 and 3 were performed.
        Results
          Effect of co-culture on gelatinase activity
          As shown in Figures 1and 2, fibroblasts alone
          routinely released primarily MMP-2 into their surrounding
          medium, as identified at the molecular weights of 72 kDa
          (latent form) and 66 kDa (active form) (Fig. 1). Over 5
          days, elastase appeared to partially convert some of the
          latent 72 kDa form to the 66 kDa form. With increasing
          incubation time, MMP-2 present in culture medium
          gradually decreased. Even at day 21, however, there was
          readily detectable MMP-2, consistent with ongoing release
          (Fig. 1a). Co-culture of monocytes and fibroblasts
          increased both bands of MMP-2 and resulted in more of the
          66 kDa form (Fig. 1b). Co-culture of fibroblasts with
          monocytes also induced the release of MMP-9 (Fig. 1b),
          which was present as the latent 92 kDa form. Addition of
          elastase nearly completely converted the latent 92 kDa
          MMP-9 to the active 83 kDa form. With increasing culture
          time, the amount of detectable MMP-9 in co-cultures
          decreased. In contrast to the co-cultures, monocytes
          cultured alone released no gelatinolytic activity (data
          Neutrophil elastase (NE) augmented and PGE 
          2 inhibited the conversion of 72 kDa
          MMP-2 to the 66 kDa form in fibroblasts cultured alone
          (Fig. 2a). In co-cultures, indomethacin resulted in a
          marked increase of conversion of MMP-9 from the 92 kDa to
          the 83 kDa form, most readily observed in the absence of
          NE, where conversion was minimal (Fig. 2b). The addition
          of exogenous PGE 
          2 decreased the conversion of MMP-9 to
          the 83 kDa form MMP-9. Neither indomethacin nor PGE 
          2 induced release of gelatinase
          activity in monocytes cultured alone (data not
          Effect of co-culture on MMP-1
          No detectable MMP-1 was observed in cultures of
          monocytes (Fig. 3). In fibroblasts alone, a trace of
          MMP-1 was occasionally detectable. In co-cultures of
          monocytes and fibroblasts, however, there was marked
          induction of MMP-1, which was present at a size
          corresponding to the latent 52 kDa form (Fig. 3). The
          detectable MMP-1 in co-cultures was maximal at earlier
          times, decreasing with increase cultured time and
          becoming undetectable by 15 days (Fig. 3). The presence
          of neutrophil elastase for the first 5 days converted
          latent MMP-1 to active 42 kDa and 20 kDa forms.
          Indomethacin augmented the induction of MMP-1 in
          co-culture (Fig. 4).
          In contrast, PGE 
          2 reduced the amount of total MMP-1
          and decreased the conversion of the 52 kDa form to the
          lower molecular weight forms in the presence of elastase.
          Neither indomethacin nor PGE 
          2 had an effect on MMP-1 in cultures
          of monocytes or fibroblasts alone.
          Effect of co-culture on MMP-3
          Neither fibroblasts nor monocytes alone released
          detectable MMP-3 (Fig. 5). In co-cultures of monocytes
          and fibroblasts, however, MMP-3 release was readily
          detected in a size corresponding to the latent 57 kDa
          form (Fig. 5). MMP-3 release was greatest at the earliest
          time points evaluated, and decreased with time becoming
          undetectable by 15 days of culture. Addition of NE for
          the first 5 days resulted in conversion of the 57 kDa
          form to active 47 and 35 kDa forms.
          Indomethacin augmented the induction of MMP-3 while
          2 reduced the conversion of MMP-3 to
          lower molecular weight forms (Fig. 6). Neither
          indomethacin nor PGE had an effect on MMP-3 on
          fibroblasts or monocytes cultured alone.
        Discussion
        In pulmonary emphysema, various inflammatory mediators
        have been suggested to cause tissue destruction and loss of
        structure [ 12, 13, 14, 15]. Several lines of evidence
        support the concept that neutrophil elastase contributes to
        the pathogenesis of emphysema [ 6, 7]. Evidence, including
        the marked expansion of macrophage numbers in smokers'
        lungs and in studies from genetically altered mice, also
        supports a role for macrophage-derived proteases in
        emphysema [ 16, 17]. These concepts are not exclusive, and
        it is possible that several proteolytic and inflammatory
        mechanisms contribute to the development of emphysema.
        In the linked study [ 5], extended co-cultures of
        fibroblasts and monocytes augmented collagen gel
        contraction and degraded the extracellular matrix. NE added
        to co-cultures resulted in a concentration-dependent
        degradation of collagen. The current study suggests that
        this increased degradation of extracellular collagen may be
        due to NE activation of latent MMPs induced in the
        co-culture conditions.
        NE has been demonstrated to result in the augmentation
        of contraction [ 4]. It also has been suggested to play an
        important role in the development of emphysema. In animals,
        instillation of NE can result in the development of
        pulmonary emphysema [ 18]. Individuals deficient in α-1
        protease inhibitor, moreover, have an increased
        susceptibility to the development of emphysema [ 19, 20,
        21]. The current study suggests the possibility that NE can
        collaborate with MMPs, leading to the degradation of
        extracellular matrix.
        The MMPs are a family of proteolytic enzymes [ 22, 23].
        Most are released as latent precursors. Proteolytic
        cleavage of the latent forms can result in generation of
        active proteases [ 24, 25]. The MMPs differ both in their
        substrate specificity and in their mechanisms of
        activation. Since some members of the MMP family are
        capable of activating other members [ 26, 27], it is likely
        that proteolytic cascades may regulate MMP activity. A
        further degree of regulation of MMP activity is afforded by
        the family of inhibitors: tissue inhibitors of
        metalloproteinases (TIMPs) [ 28].
        Recent studies in genetically altered mice have
        suggested an important role for multiple proteases in the
        development of emphysema. Mice deficient in MMP-9, MMP-12,
        or NE are resistant to the development of emphysema or skin
        blisters [ 8, 16]. Mice overexpressing collagenase,
        however, develop emphysema [ 14]. The current study
        proposes a possible collaboration among proteases that is
        responsible for the tissue degradation associated with the
        disease.
        According to results from this study, several proteases
        are induced in co-cultures and activated in the presence of
        NE. It is likely that other proteolytic enzymes may also
        play a role beyond those evaluated in the current study. In
        this context, fibroblasts are known to express cell surface
        proteases, which may have a major role in regulating the
        activity of other mediators in the extracellular milieu [
        29, 30, 31]. It is of interest that PGE 
        2 appears to be able to regulate the
        protease activity responsible for extracellular matrix
        degradation.
        It is unlikely that PGE 
        2 functions directly as a protease
        inhibitor. It seems more plausible that PGE 
        2 regulates proteolytic activity by
        altering the production of antiproteases, or by altering
        the production of components essential in the proteolytic
        cascade leading to collagen degradation [ 31]. The sequence
        of proteolytic events, by which NE leads to collagen
        degradation, is incompletely defined. PGE 
        2 , however, could potentially modulate
        the proteolytic cascade, resulting in collagen degradation
        at a number of steps. Both PGE 
        2 and a cascade of proteolytic events
        that lead to extracellular matrix degradation have the
        potential for serving as paracrine regulators. Such a means
        of regulation may be particularly important in tissue
        remodeling. It seems unlikely that tissue remodeling is
        accomplished by individually active fibroblasts. Rather,
        coordinated activity within a tissue would seem to be a
        more appropriate means to accomplish alteration in tissue
        structure. Paracrine regulation would seem to be ideally
        suited to accomplish such an effect.
        Conclusion
        This study demonstrates that monocytes and fibroblasts
        in co-culture can release MMPs and degrade extracellular
        matrix. Activation of MMPs by NE can augment this process.
        2 can modulate this proteolytic cascade.
        These data support a role for collaborative interaction
        among inflammatory mediators leading to tissue destruction
        in diseases such as emphysema.

          Materials and methods
            Cells and cultures
            Human fetal lung fibroblasts (cell line HFL-1),
            obtained from the American Type Culture Collection
            (Rockville, MD, USA), were cultured with Dulbecco's
            Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10%
            fetal-calf serum, 50 U/ml penicillin, 50 μg/ml
            streptomycin and 0.25 μg/ml fungizone. The cells were
            cultured in 100 mm tissue culture dishes (Falcon,
            Becton Dickinson Labware, Lincoln Park, NJ, USA). The
            fibroblasts were passaged every week. Subconfluent
            fibroblasts were trypsinized (trypsin-EDTA; 0.05%
            trypsin, 0.53 mM EDTA-4 Na) and used for collagen gel
            culture. Fibroblasts used in these experiments were
            between cell passages 14 and 16. Blood monocytes were
            isolated from blood cells of healthy blood donors [
            32]. Cell suspensions were >96% monocytes by the
            criteria of cell morphology on Wright stained
            cytosmears. Monocytes were stored at 4°C and were used
            for co-culture within 4 hours after isolation.
            Reagents
            Human neutrophil elastase was purchased from ECP
            (Owensville, MO, USA). Prostaglandin E 
            2 ) and indomethacin were purchased
            from Sigma (St. Louis, MO, USA). Tissue culture
            supplements and media were purchased from GIBCO (Life
            Technologies, Grand Island, NY, USA). Fetal calf serum
            was purchased from Biofluid (Rockville, MD, USA).
            Preparation of collagen gels
            Tendons were excised from rat tails, and the tendon
            sheath and other connective tissue were removed
            carefully. After repeated washing with Tris-buffered
            saline (TBS, 0.9% NaCl, 10 mM Tris, pH7.5) and serial
            concentrations of ethanol (from 50% to 100%), type I
            collagen was extracted in 6 mM hydrochloric acid at 4°C
            for 24 hours. Protein concentration was determined by
            weighing a lyophilized aliquot from each lot of
            collagen solution. Sodium dodecyl sulfate
            polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis routinely determined
            no detectable protein other than type I collagen.
            Gelatinase activity assay
            Conditioned media were concentrated fivefold by
            ethanol precipitation and resuspension in distilled H 
            2 O. The samples were dissolved in
            twofold electrophoresis sample buffer (0.5 M Tris-HCL,
            pH6.8, 2% SDS, 20% glycerol, 0.1% bromophenol blue),
            and heated for 5 min at 95°C. Thirty microliters of
            each sample were loaded in each lane, and
            electrophoresis was performed with a Mini
            Electrophoresis Cell (BIO-RID, Hercules, CA, USA) at
            200 V. After electrophoresis, the gels were gently
            soaked with 2.5% (v/v) Triton-X 100 at 20°C for 30 min,
            then incubated in the metalloproteinase buffer (0.06 M
            Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 6 mM CaCl 
            2 and 1 μM ZnCl) for 18 hours at
            37°C. The gels were stained with 0.4% (w/v) Coomassie
            blue and rapidly destained with 30% (v/v) methanol, 10%

            blue, 0.5% β-mercaptoethanol, 20% glycerol). After
            heating for 3 min at 95°C, 30μl of each sample was
            loaded for electrophoresis with a Mini Electrophoresis

            for 35 min with a Semi-dry Electrophoretic Transfer
            Cell (BIO-RAD, Hercules, CA, USA). The blots were
            blocked in 5% fat-free milk in PBS-Tween at room
            temperature for 1 hour, then exposed to primary
            antibodies (mouse anti-human MMP-1, MMP-2, MMP-3 or
